Documentation       LO-3.2.2.1-2    K2    Understand how multiple lines can be used to define scalar variables
...
...                 This demo illustrates the powerful multiline variable feature in Robot Framework:
...                 - Defining long text content across multiple lines for better readability
...                 - Using different separators (space vs newline vs custom)
...                 - Practical applications in forms, messages, and configuration

*** Variables ***
# === MULTILINE VARIABLES WITH SPACE SEPARATOR (DEFAULT) ===
# When no separator is specified, parts are joined with single spaces
# This is useful for long sentences or paragraphs that should flow together

${MULTILINE_SPACE}      Value split across
...                     multiple lines
...                     for readability.
# Result: "Value split across multiple lines for readability."

${LONG_PRODUCT_DESC}    This is a comprehensive description of our premium hammer
...                     which features an ergonomic handle design
...                     and a balanced weight distribution
...                     for optimal performance in construction tasks.

# === MULTILINE VARIABLES WITH NEWLINE SEPARATOR ===
# Using separator=\n preserves line breaks in the final text
# This is essential for multi-paragraph content, addresses, or poetry

${MULTILINE_NEWLINE}    Line one
...                     Line two
...                     Line three
...                     Line four with a bit more text
...                     separator=\n

${CONTACT_MESSAGE}      Dear Customer Service Team,
...
...                     I am writing to inquire about the return policy
...                     for the hammer I purchased last week.

...                     Please let me know the next steps.
...
...                     Best regards,

# === MULTILINE VARIABLES WITH CUSTOM SEPARATORS ===
# Custom separators allow for specific formatting needs
