The idea is to turn the repeated contact form steps into a reusable user keyword that requires:
- firstname
- lastname
- email
- subject

1. Define a user keyword called Submit Contact Form that takes four mandatory arguments: first name, last name, email, subject
2. Use this keyword in your test case, providing the required values.
3. Create a second test and provide different values

    Fill Text               data-test=message       This is a pretty long message, because short messages don't pass the validation. Hopefully this long message does.
