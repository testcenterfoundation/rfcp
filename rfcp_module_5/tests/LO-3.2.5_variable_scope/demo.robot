Documentation       LO-3.2.5    K2    Understand how local and suite scope variables are created
...
...                 This demo explores variable scope concepts in Robot Framework:
...                 - Suite scope variables (Variables section)
...                 - Test scope variables (created within test cases)
...                 - Local scope variables (created within keywords)
...                 - Scope isolation and accessibility rules
...                 - Scope promotion using Set Variable keywords

Library             Browser

Test Setup          Open Browser And Set Context


*** Variables ***
# === SUITE SCOPE VARIABLES ===
# These variables are defined in the *** Variables *** section
# They are available to ALL test cases in this suite
# Suite scope has the longest lifetime - from suite start to suite end

${SUITE_SCOPE_URL}      https://practicesoftwaretesting.com
${SUITE_CONFIG}         Production Configuration
${SUITE_TIMEOUT}        ${30}
${SUITE_BROWSER}        chromium
${SUITE_COUNTER}        ${0}


*** Test Cases ***
Demonstrate Suite Scope Variables
    [Documentation]    Show how suite scope variables work and are accessible everywhere.
    ...
    ...                Suite scope variables are defined in the Variables section
    ...                and are accessible from all test cases and keywords.

    Log To Console      \n=== SUITE SCOPE DEMONSTRATION ===

    # Access suite scope variables
    Log To Console      Suite URL: ${SUITE_SCOPE_URL}
    Log To Console      Suite config: ${SUITE_CONFIG}
    Log To Console      Suite timeout: ${SUITE_TIMEOUT}
    Log To Console      Suite browser: ${SUITE_BROWSER}

    # Use suite variable in browser operations
    New Page            ${SUITE_SCOPE_URL}
    ${title}=           Get Title
    Log To Console      Page title: ${title}
    Should Contain      ${title}    Practice Software Testing

    # Demonstrate suite variable accessibility in keywords
    Access Suite Variables From Keyword

    # Increment suite counter to show it persists
    ${new_counter}=     Evaluate    ${SUITE_COUNTER} + 1
    Set Suite Variable  ${SUITE_COUNTER}    ${new_counter}
    Log To Console      Updated suite counter: ${SUITE_COUNTER}

Demonstrate Test Scope Variables
    [Documentation]    Show how test scope variables work and their limitations.
    ...
    ...                Test scope variables are created within test cases and
    ...                are only accessible within that specific test case.

    Log To Console      \n=== TEST SCOPE DEMONSTRATION ===

    # Create test scope variables
    ${test_url}=        Set Variable    https://v4.practicesoftwaretesting.com

    Log To Console      Suite counter from test: ${SUITE_COUNTER}

    # Note: ${test_url}, ${test_data}, ${test_counter} will NOT be accessible
    # in other test cases - they have test scope only

Demonstrate Test Scope Isolation
    [Documentation]    Show that variables from other tests are not accessible.
    ...
    ...                This test demonstrates scope isolation between test cases.

    Log To Console      \n=== TEST SCOPE ISOLATION ===

    # Suite variables are still accessible
    Log To Console      Suite URL still accessible: ${SUITE_SCOPE_URL}
    Log To Console      Suite counter from previous test: ${SUITE_COUNTER}

    # Test variables from previous test are NOT accessible
    # Uncommenting the next line would cause a failure:
    # Log To Console      Previous test URL: ${test_url}  # Would fail!

    # Create new test-specific variables
    ${this_test_var}=   Set Variable    This test only
    ${another_var}=     Set Variable    Also this test only

    Log To Console      This test variable: ${this_test_var}
    Log To Console      Another test variable: ${another_var}

    Log To Console      \n=== LOCAL SCOPE DEMONSTRATION ===

    # Call a keyword that creates local variables
    Create Local Variables

    # Call another keyword to show local variables are not accessible
    Try To Access Local Variables

    # Demonstrate scope promotion
    ${promoted_var}=    Create And Return Local Variable

    Pass Variables To Keyword    Data 1    Data 2    Data 3

Demonstrate Scope Promotion
    [Documentation]    Show how to promote variables to higher scopes.
    ...

    Log To Console      \n=== SCOPE PROMOTION DEMONSTRATION ===

    # Create a local variable and promote it
    ${local_value}=     Set Variable    Originally local

    # Promote to test scope
    Set Test Variable   ${promoted_to_test}    ${local_value}
    Log To Console      Promoted to test scope: ${promoted_to_test}

    # Promote to suite scope
    Set Suite Variable  ${promoted_to_suite}   ${local_value}
    Log To Console      Promoted to suite scope: ${promoted_to_suite}

    # Demonstrate promotion in keywords
    Promote Variables From Keyword

    Log To Console      Processed ${processed_items} items

    # Scenario 2: Configuration override
    ${original_timeout}=    Set Variable    ${SUITE_TIMEOUT}
    Log To Console      Original timeout: ${original_timeout}

    # Temporarily override for this test
    ${test_timeout}=    Set Variable    ${60}
    Log To Console      Test-specific timeout: ${test_timeout}

    # Use test-specific value without affecting suite variable
    Wait For Condition With Timeout    ${test_timeout}

    # Verify suite variable unchanged
    Log To Console      Suite timeout still: ${SUITE_TIMEOUT}

        Log To Console      Keyword-promoted suite variable: ${keyword_to_suite}
    EXCEPT
        Log To Console      Some suite variables not accessible (expected if running individual test)
    END

    # Test-promoted variables should NOT be accessible here
    TRY
        Log To Console      This should not work: ${promoted_to_test}
    EXCEPT
        Log To Console      Test-scoped variables correctly not accessible (expected)
