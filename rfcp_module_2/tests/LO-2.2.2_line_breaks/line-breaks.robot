Instructions: The following test has very long lines that are hard to read. Use Robot Framework's continuation syntax to break them into multiple lines for better readability.

1. Use ... (three dots) at the beginning of continuation lines
2. Continuation lines should be indented more than the original line
3. Break long strings logically as variables
4. Maintain proper spacing between arguments
